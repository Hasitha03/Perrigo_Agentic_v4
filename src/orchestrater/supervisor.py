        day scenarios (e.g., 5-day, 4-day, or 3-day delivery options).By applying consolidation day mappings, the agent
        aggregates shipments into fewer deliveries, reducing overall costs. The results include: Total shipment costs before and after consolidation ,

- "What kind of data does this system analyze?"
- "I'm not sure how to phrase my question about cost optimization"
- "What's the difference between Static and Dynamic Cost Optimization?"

Examples of when to route to specialized agents:
- "Analyze the shipment data and tell me which postcode has the highest delivery cost" (Insights Agent)
- "How can we optimize our delivery schedule to reduce costs?" (Cost Optimization Agents)
- "What if we increased our truck capacity by 20%?" (Generate Scenario Agent)
