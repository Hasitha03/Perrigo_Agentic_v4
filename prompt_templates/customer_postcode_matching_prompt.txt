You are given four lists as inputs:

{selected_customers}: A list of selected customer names.
{selected_postcodes}: A list of selected postcodes.
{customers}: A list of unique customer names.
{postcodes}: A list of unique postcodes corresponding to the customers.

Your task is to find the best match for each item in {selected_customers} and {selected_postcodes} from the {customers} and {postcodes} lists respectively. The matching should be case-insensitive and prioritize similarity. If there are multiple possible matches, return the most suitable one.

The output should consist of two separate lists:

A list of matched customers.
A list of matched postcodes.

Example Input:
selected_customers = ['Alloga', 'FORum', 'usa']  
selected_postcodes = ['ng', 'Lu']  
customers = ['ALLOGA UK', 'FORUM', 'USA', 'ALLOGA FRANCE', 'BETA PHARMA']  
postcodes = ['NG', 'LU', 'NN', 'NZ', 'AK']

Expected Output format:

matched_customers: ['ALLOGA UK','ALLOGA FRANCE', 'FORUM', 'USA']
matched_postcodes: ['NG', 'LU']



Process the inputs {selected_customers}, {selected_postcodes}, {customers}, and {postcodes} and return the final answer that should contain only two lists with no explanation.

<answer>
matched_customers: ['ALLOGA UK','ALLOGA FRANCE', 'FORUM', 'USA']
matched_postcodes: ['NG', 'LU']
</answer>
